<h1>Git Commands for Effective Version Control</h1>

<p>This page introduces some fundamental Git commands used on GitHub to manage your code effectively. Remember, you'll be using these commands in your terminal or command prompt.</p>

<h2>1. `git init`</h2>

<p class="command">Initializing a Git Repository</p>

<p>The `git init` command is the first step. It creates a new Git repository within your local project directory. This tells Git to start tracking changes to your code files.</p>

<p class="code">git init</p>

<h2>2. `git add`</h2>

<p class="command">Adding Files to the Staging Area</p>

<p>The `git add` command tells Git which files you want to include in your next commit. You can add individual files or use wildcards like `git add *` to add all modified files in the current directory.</p>

<p class="code">
  git add filename.txt<br>
  git add *  (Add all modified files)
</p>

<h2>3. `git commit`</h2>

<p class="command">Committing Changes to the Repository</p>

<p>The `git commit` command creates a snapshot of your currently staged changes (files added with `git add`).  It's crucial to provide a descriptive commit message summarizing the changes you made.</p>

<p class="code">git commit -m "Added new feature X"</p>

<h2>4. `git push`</h2>

<p class="command">Pushing Committed Changes to GitHub</p>

<p>The `git push` command uploads your local commits to a remote Git repository, typically hosted on GitHub. You'll need to have your GitHub repository set up and linked to your local project for this to work.</p>

<p class="code">git push origin master  (assuming your remote branch is named 'master')</p>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

* You can use `git status` to check the status of your working directory, staged files, and uncommitted changes.
* Consider using `git branch` to manage different development branches within your project.
* Refer to the official Git documentation for more advanced commands and functionalities: https://www.git-scm.com/

By mastering these foundational Git commands, you can effectively manage your code versions and collaborate seamlessly on projects using GitHub.

This page explains the purpose of each command, provides code examples, and includes additional notes for further exploration. Remember to replace `filename.txt` with the actual name of your file and adjust the remote branch name (`master` in the example) if needed.
