    <h1>HTML Headings: Structure and Significance</h1>
    <p>
      HTML headings, denoted by ""h1" to "h6" tags, establish a hierarchical
      structure for your web page's content, conveying its organization and
      importance to both users and search engines.

      <dd>
        h1: The most important heading, typically used for the main title of the
        page. There should only be one h1 per page.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        h2 to h6: Subsequent subheadings, progressively decreasing in
        significance.
